# Team Contract

## Division of Work and Quality Review

We will divide the portions of each milestone in an equal portion according to the grading weights and the workload, with attention towards individual preference and strength. If there are items or work which nobody is enthusiastic towards, then we will take turns accepting these tasks.

Each change will be made through a simplified git workflow. Quality control will consist of a github pull request review order, wherein the reviewer will enforce quality control on the originating contributorâ€™s work and merge branch. The pull request initiator should not generally be the one also reviewing and merging PRs.

## Meetings and Working Hours

We will aim to meet twice weekly; Monday during lab time 2-4pm, and Friday 11 am (ONLINE). We will also aim to use some of the free working lecture time to collaborate, if applicable.

One group member will be responsible for each Milestone on a turn by turn basis. Friday meetings will have a crowd-sourced agenda in a github issue, and the group member responsible for the milestone will generate issues that are identified during the meeting. Other meetings will not be captured in minutes. We will capture any collaborative work and decisions as issues in github.

Expected individual working hours should not surpass a maximum 6 hours.

We have agreed on a *soft deadline* of Friday night at 5PM, with an understanding that there might be times where this is not possible. Submission should be targeted for that same timeframe.

Milestone Owners:

Milestone 1: Chaoran
Milestone 2: Gabe
Milestone 3: Katia
Milestone 4: TZ

## Collaboration

We will aim to collaborate and make decisions mainly through GitHub issues. We will use slack for logistical and purely procedural discussions (confirmation of due dates, scheduling issues,etc).

We will also initiate a project board to track progress on issues.

## Breach of Contract

We will handle code of conduct and breach of contract in a similar 3 step process:

1. The first step is notice in slack that explains the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.

2. The second step is an in-person (or at least online synchronous) meeting to discuss the behaviour and something is required by the offending team member acknowledging the concern and indicating it will be resolved.
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs.
