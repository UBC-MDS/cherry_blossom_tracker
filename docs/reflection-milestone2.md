** Reflection **

Overall our group is VERY happy with how our dashboard turned out. Everyone put in a lot of work, and the vision and functionality were focused and well-defined. We managed to include several
optional features including the full map and several other small functionalities. We arent aware or any bugs or features under development. 

As it stands i think that the dashboard achieves it's goal functionality well. One shortcoming is that the data used is static and will not update dynamically from the city, 
and the bloom dates are set for 2022 and will therefore not roll over to subsequent years without manual intervention. We also could develop a strategy to impute NaN values, as we are currently dropping a decent amount of data due to them.
