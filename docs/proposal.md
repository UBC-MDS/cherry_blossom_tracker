## Section 3. Research questions and usage scenarios


**Research questions:**

1. Where are the most rewarding places to view the cherry blossoms in Vancouver?
2. What types of trees appear in what neighbourhoods?
3. When are the trees most likely to blossom? blossoms most probably blooming?

**Usage Scenario:**

Tom is an international tourist planning to visit Vancouver for the first time during the yearly cherry blossom season. Tom is a huge cherry blossom enthusiast and wants a tool where he can learn more about cherry blossom trees in Vancouver. He wishes to stay in a hotel that is within walking distance to nearby cherry blossoms viewing spots. Tom is a visual person, hence he wants to view this information on a map. The map will be able to show the position of each tree, as well as the cultivars and tree diameter. Tom also wants to find out which neighbourhood has the most Cherry Blossoms, how many cultivars of cherry blossoms there are, and where the biggest cherry blossom trees (by diameter) are located. The tool should be interactive, such that when he filters by e.g. different cultivars of cherry blossoms, the map will also reflect the change.
