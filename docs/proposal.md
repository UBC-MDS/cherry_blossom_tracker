## Research questions and usage scenarios

Tom is an international tourist planning to visit Vancouver for the first time during the yearly Cherry Blossom Season. Tom is a huge Cherry Blossom enthusiast and wants a tool where he can learn more about cherry blossom trees in Vancouver. He wishes to stay in a hotel that is within walking distance to nearby Cherry Blossoms viewing spots. Tom is a visual person, hence he wants to view this information on a map. The map will be able to show the position of each tree, as well as the species and tree diameter. Tom also wants to find out which neighbourhood has the most Cherry Blossoms, how many species of Cherry Blossoms there are, and where is the biggest Cherry Blossom trees (by diameter). The tool should be interactive, such that when he filters by e.g. different species of Cherry Blossoms, the map will also reflect the change.
